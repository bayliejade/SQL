I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 
select count (*)
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
Where type = 'movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
select max(date(date_added))
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
select title 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
order By title asc; 

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
select director 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
left join "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
on title.show_id=people.show_id
where title.title='Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
select title, release_year
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
 where type = 'movie'
 order by release_year
 limit 1;
